#    This is calibration data for the aerosol Raman spectrometer
#    Used in the Doughty and Hill JQSRT papers (2019)
#    The calibration is for 8/25/2016
#    Calibration values are a combination of the two full
#        calibrations measured before and after this day.
#        full calibrations done using the lines from a neon lamp.
#    The determined laser wavelengths measured using 
#        the 520.7 cm-1 peak on a silicon slab are an average
#        of eight silicon measurements made during the full 
#        calibrations and during field calibrations with only
#        the silicon slab used.
#    Uncertainty notes: Between 400 and 1800 cm-1, its +0.56/-0.86,
#        above 2700, its +3.29/-3.58. These are the worst case errors.        real error is likely to be less. Errors change with 
#        wavelength, with the lowest magnitudes between 500-1500 cm-1
#        but some cross zero at two places in this range.
#    Please see doughty and hill (2019) in the supplement for a
#        comparison of different calibrations
